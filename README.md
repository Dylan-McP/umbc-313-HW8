PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE: to perform matrix calculations in both C++ and C.
FILES: matrixPlus.cpp is the C++ matrix library, and it hold the class definition as well as main(); matrix.c is the C matrix library, and it holds the function definition as well as main()
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS: The files were written on the Linux GL servers for UMBC. Standard compilation on GL should be all that's necessary.
TESTING METHODOLOGY: The size and initial values of Matrices A, B, and C, as well as the scalar value are inputted by the user to make sure that the calculations were valid and the programs do more than just the test function, as directed by the announcement. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The program is only able to perform the calculations in the order of operations of the presented equation.
